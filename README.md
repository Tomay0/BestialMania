# BestialMania

## Original concept
This project is an unfinished 3D Game. Originally planned to be an online PvP fighting game with platforming elements, this project was cancelled due to being too much work.

## The project in its current form
The current progress shows work on a 3D Game engine, with platforming physics and some test character animation. An online lobby system has also been implemented. There is no objective or actual gameplay implemented, but the game can currently be played with up to 4 simultaneous players using splitscreen with controllers.

## Installation
If you would like to view the project for yourself, you can clone the server branch and open the project using a Java IDE (ideally IntelliJ). Include the lib/ folder and the natives library for your operating system located within natives/ (Tested on Linux and Windows, but Mac may work). You should have a decent graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3. Any other compatibility issues I am not sure about.
